Age Detection Using Images Developed a robust machine learning system capable of estimating a personâ€™s age from their facial image. Leveraged deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze facial features and predict age accurately. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, model optimization, and testing to ensure reliability.

Key Features:

Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Use a dataset like IMDB-WIKI or similar datasets with labeled facial images and corresponding ages.

Apply preprocessing steps such as facial detection, cropping, resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

Model Architecture:

Use a convolutional neural network (CNN), either designed from scratch or adapted from pre-trained models (e.g., VGGNet, ResNet, or MobileNet).
Training & Testing:

Train the model on a labeled dataset and fine-tune using evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE).

Evaluate performance on unseen test data for accuracy and generalization.

Applications:

Age-based access controls (e.g., for apps or services).

Personalized marketing and customer experience enhancement.

Demographic analysis in market research.

Tools & Technologies:

Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

Image preprocessing libraries (e.g., PIL, Scikit-Image)
